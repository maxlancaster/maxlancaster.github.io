# PBE Family TreeThis is a small web application I built using the d3.js data visualization library that allows members of my fraternity to explore their family lines.If you're in PBE, take a look and make sure your information looks correct. If you have information about family lines that extend earlier than those I've included, please let me know at mlancast@mit.edu.Mistakes, bugs, suggestions: mlancast@mit.edu
