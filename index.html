					<h3 style=" margin-left:5px">Networking God Dave Clark <small>5/12/2016</small></h3>
					<p style=" margin-left:5px">It's been about a month since I last wrote on here. Life has kind of gotten in the way. Today in my Computer Systems Engineering lecture we had a guest lecturer, Dave Clark. If you don't know who he is, you should. He's a networking god. He was a major player in building the Internet. He implemented the Internet protocols for Multics. Today, Dave spoke mostly about net neutrality. It was interesting to learn about net neutrality from a business perspective, since it's something we've been learning about all semester from a technical standpoint. My personal favorite quote from the lecture: "The Internet runs on beer."</p>

					<h3 style=" margin-left:5px">Blocks-based Programming Languages <small>4/11/2016</small></h3>
					<p style=" margin-left:5px">Here's a draft of a paper that I wrote about the benefits of blocks-based programming languages in classrooms. For the past two years, I've worked in the MIT Media Lab on <a href="https://gameblox.org">Gameblox</a> -- a blocks-based programming language designed to build and prototype games. I'll be polishing this draft into a final paper in the next few weeks.</p>

					<p style=" margin-left:5px">Made some awesome quesadillas tonight with one of my roommates Dave and my beautiful girlfriend Amanda. We burned a couple but it was a grand old time, nonetheless.</p>

					<h3 style=" margin-left:5px">This Summer - Salesforce <small>3/25/2016</small></h3>
					<p style=" margin-left:5px">Just the other day I finalized my plans for this summer: I'll be interning at Salesforce in San Francisco with one of the Big Data teams. I'm really excited for this summer. I think it will be a great learning experience, and I am pumped to live in SF. I've been told that I will be doing mostly backend work, which will be good because I don't have much experience with that. I also just found out that they have a spot for me in corporate housing, which will save me a big headache in trying to find a place to live in San Francisco. I've heard good things about the Salesforce corporate housing, so this is good. They also sent me a cool sweatshirt, which you can see me sporting in the picture below.</p>

					<h3 style=" margin-left:5px">First Post! <small>3/24/2016</small></h3>
					<p style=" margin-left:5px">Hello! Welcome to my blog. This is the first official post. What is this place? Well, I'm not quite sure. My vision for this blog is that it will be a place for me to write about fun things I do, interesting computer science topics/problems/solutions I come across, and any other random thoughts I might have. I often find that when I think back to a fun thing I did, the one thing I wish I could remember is how I felt after doing that thing. This blog will be a way for me to keep track of all of the thoughts and reactions I have to the things I come across.</p>
