					<p style=" margin-left:5px">Again, it's been quite some time since I've posted anything up here. I think just about a week now. I was hoping to post updates at least a few times a week, but I've failed to do that so far. I'll be better. I actually had some content lined up to push, but I came down with some stomach bug this weekend so I never got around to it. Anyways, this post will be a big update of the past week.
					</p>
					<p style="margin-left:5px">So this weekend, I met up with a friend from home who works at Uber. His name is Dave Stevens, and you can see a picture of him below. He's been in the bay area for just over a year now after graduating from Williams College, so chatting with him was a really good way for me to figure out some San Francisco "must-dos" for this summer. We met up at a place called <a href="http://starbellysf.com/">starbelly</a>, which had a nice outdoor patio. Unfortunately I didn't take any photos :( but I had the wild mushroom pizza which was solid.
					</p>

					<p style="margin-left:5px">After lunch we headed over to the famous Dolores Park where essentially everybody in SF goes on the weekends. I had heard that this was a *magical* park without any rules, but I didn't fully comprehend that until visiting. This place was absolutely packed (and I was told that my visit was on a slow day!). By no rules, I guess they mean that people can drink and smoke and do all sorts of drugs to their heart's content, because that's what Dolores Park is like. The views are stunning; you can see a few in the photos below. In the distance of the first picture you can see a bright light... I was told that this is known as the God building. I still have to find out what building that actually is.

					<p style="margin-left:5px"> After our *magical* time in Dolores Park, Dave and I left for a quick tour of his friend Matt's apartment. Matt mentioned to me earlier in the day that he enjoyed interior design, and it was sure as hell evident in the way his place looked. His place looked like something out of magazine. Check out some pics below.

					<p style="margin-left:5px">OK, the last of our adventure's on this Sunday afternoon was a party at Dave's friend Benjamin's apartment. Benjamin is an executive at Apple, so his place was also like a palace. The windows out the back of his living room gave way to beautiful views of San Francisco. We mostly just chilled/chatted and drank fancy champagne.

					<p style="margin-left:5px">I thought this photo was particularly cool because the left half of the city was covered by a shadow beneath a cloud, and the right half was perfectly sunny.
					</p>

					<p style="margin-left:5px">Also, here's another leftover picture I took of my roommates Keion and Aaron from one day when we were exploring downtown.
					</p>
					<img class="post-image" src="graphics/keion-and-aaron.jpg">
					<p style="margin-left:5px">I'll be in Aruba all of next week, so I hope to have some sweet photos from that trip up here soon. Also, I plan to make this UI not nearly as shitty sometime soon, so if you're ever on here and things don't look right, it could be because I'm changing things up. Love and miss you all. -Max

					<p style=" margin-left:5px">OK it's been ten days since I put anything up on here. I arrived in SF Saturday afternoon, and it's now Tuesday night. 
					</p>
					<img class="post-image" src="graphics/welcome-to-sf.jpg">
					<p style=" margin-left:5px"> These first few days have been pretty awesome, besides being 2500 miles from everybody that I love. After arriving Saturday, I spent the afternoon unpacking and settling in. I've got 3 roommates: Keion's from LA, Aaron's from San jose, and Srinath is from Arizona. They are all really interesting dudes and we seem to get along well. Here's a picture of the place, and the view from our kitchen.

					<p style=" margin-left:5px">On Sunday afternoon I went to my first Giant's game. AT&T park is literally a two minute walk down the street from our place. I'm pretty certain that almost all of my pay is gonna be spent on Giant's tickets. Being the fanatic that I am, I showed up like 3 hours before the game. I was also able to sweet-talk one of the security workers into letting me upstairs into the club level. That's where I took this first photo.

						That same woman told me that I needed to try the AT&T park garlic fries. I wasn't a huge fan, 5/10.

						Work has been awesome so far. I'm on the Salesforce Identity team, working on two cool projects. One of them is actually in collab with the project manager. His name is Matt, and I'm excited to work with him. We get free breakfast, coffee, lunch, and snacks all day. This is a pic of the full service coffee bar located on the first floor of my office. Totally free. I'm gonna drink so much coffee this summer. I miss everybody back home very much. I'm having a blast out here so far. I'll try to post again soon. - Max

					<h3 style=" margin-left:5px">Semester Wrap Up <small>5/14/2016</small></h3>
					<p style=" margin-left:5px">My last official turn-in assignment for Sophomore year was the revision of the science essay which I posted a few weeks ago (early April ish). Submitting that marks the unofficial end to sophomore year (still have to crush two finals). 

						<a class = "post-content" href="other-stuff/Science_Essay_for_the_General_Public_final_draft_complete.pdf">A Science Essay for the General Public (Revised Version)</a>

					I'm a big to-do list guy, so it was sweet to cross that final thing off my last to-do list for the semester. It's been a crazy semester between classes and baseball, but it feels good to be done. It's crazy how much I've learned since coming to MIT. The environment here is so intense, like nothing I've ever experienced before. Fucking love it.</p>

					<h3 style=" margin-left:5px">Networking God Dave Clark <small>5/12/2016</small></h3>
					<p style=" margin-left:5px">It's been about a month since I last wrote on here. Life has kind of gotten in the way. Today in my Computer Systems Engineering lecture we had a guest lecturer, Dave Clark. If you don't know who he is, you should. He's a networking god. He was a major player in building the Internet. He implemented the Internet protocols for Multics. Today, Dave spoke mostly about net neutrality. It was interesting to learn about net neutrality from a business perspective, since it's something we've been learning about all semester from a technical standpoint. My personal favorite quote from the lecture: "The Internet runs on beer."</p>

					<p style=" margin-left:5px">Here's a draft of a paper that I wrote about the benefits of blocks-based programming languages in classrooms. For the past two years, I've worked in the MIT Media Lab on <a href="https://gameblox.org">Gameblox</a> -- a blocks-based programming language designed to build and prototype games. I'll be polishing this draft into a final paper in the next few weeks.</p>

					<h3 style=" margin-left:5px">This Summer - Salesforce <small>3/25/2016</small></h3>
					<p style=" margin-left:5px">Just the other day I finalized my plans for this summer: I'll be interning at Salesforce in San Francisco with one of the Big Data teams. I'm really excited for this summer. I think it will be a great learning experience, and I am pumped to live in SF. I've been told that I will be doing mostly backend work, which will be good because I don't have much experience with that. I also just found out that they have a spot for me in corporate housing, which will save me a big headache in trying to find a place to live in San Francisco. I've heard good things about the Salesforce corporate housing, so this is good. They also sent me a cool sweatshirt, which you can see me sporting in the picture below.</p>

					<p style=" margin-left:5px">Hello! Welcome to my blog. This is the first official post. What is this place? Well, I'm not quite sure. My vision for this blog is that it will be a place for me to write about fun things I do, interesting computer science topics/problems/solutions I come across, and any other random thoughts I might have. I often find that when I think back to a fun thing I did, the one thing I wish I could remember is how I felt after doing that thing. This blog will be a way for me to keep track of all of the thoughts and reactions I have to the things I come across.</p>
